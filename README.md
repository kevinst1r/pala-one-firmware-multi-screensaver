# pala-one-firmware
Pala One — A tiny E-Ink reader project by Paul Lagier

The goal of the project was to create a simple, distraction-free reading device that feels minimal, portable and easy to build while still looking and behaving more like a real product than a typical DIY electronics project.

## Contributing

If you improve the firmware, add features or fix bugs, feel free to open a pull request.
Please clearly mention:
- which board version(s) you tested on (V1.1, V1.2, or both)
- what was changed
- how it was tested

## Board Versions

There are currently two supported Heltec Wireless Paper versions:
- `Heltec V1.1`
- `Heltec V1.2`

The board version is usually printed on the back of the PCB.

Pick your board's revision in the build step below — either by uncommenting the matching `#define` at the top of `Pala_One_2_1/Pala_One_2_1.ino` (Arduino IDE), or by selecting the matching env (PlatformIO).

## Building the firmware

The same sources build under either toolchain.

### Arduino IDE 2

1. Install the **esp32 by Espressif Systems** board package (Boards Manager) and select the **Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3** board.
2. Install these libraries via Library Manager (or by URL):
   - [`heltec-eink-modules`](https://github.com/todd-herbert/heltec-eink-modules) (todd-herbert fork)
   - **Adafruit GFX Library** (Adafruit)
   - **U8g2_for_Adafruit_GFX** (olikraus)
3. Open `Pala_One_2_1/Pala_One_2_1.ino`. Uncomment exactly one of `BOARD_V1_1` / `BOARD_V1_2` at the top.
4. Tools → Partition Scheme → **Custom** (the sketch ships its own `partitions.csv`).
5. Verify / Upload.

### PlatformIO

1. Install [PlatformIO Core](https://platformio.org/install/cli) (CLI) or the PlatformIO IDE extension for VS Code.
2. From the repo root:
   ```
   pio run -e wireless-paper-v1_2 -t upload    # V1.2 panel
   pio run -e wireless-paper-v1_1 -t upload    # V1.1 panel
   ```
3. Serial monitor:
   ```
   pio device monitor
   ```

Both envs share libraries and partition table via `platformio.ini`. The PIO build also runs `scripts/build_info.py` to inject the current git short hash as `BUILD_GIT_HASH`; Arduino IDE builds fall back to `"unknown"`.

## Codebase layout

    ├── ui/              # Screens, fonts, sleep, toasts, widgets

test/                    # Host-side CMake unit tests for pure/ + storage/
examples/                # Sample apps (click_counter, palagotchi)
archive/                 # Past firmware revisions, kept for reference
```

The intent of the layering is **pure → storage → hal → ui**: pure modules never include `Arduino.h`, so they compile into the host test build verbatim. Storage adds an on-disk persistence shim behind `KeyValueStore`, hal isolates the hardware, and the UI sits on top.

### Include style

Firmware sources include each other by the full path from the sketch root, e.g. `#include "src/hal/display.h"`, not the shorter `#include "hal/display.h"`.

This is to stay compatible with Arduino IDE. The IDE recursively compiles files inside the `src/` subfolder of a sketch, **but does not add `src/` to the compiler's include path** — only the sketch folder root is on it. So `#include "config.h"` from a file at sketch root fails (the file actually lives at `src/config.h`), whereas `#include "src/config.h"` resolves correctly. PlatformIO is happy either way; we picked the Arduino-IDE-compatible form so the same `#include` lines work in both build systems with no extra `-I` flags.

## Host-side tests

Pure modules and KV-backed storage have host-side unit tests under [`test/`](test/). They build with CMake and run on your laptop — no board required.

See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for prerequisites (CMake + a C++17 compiler) and per-platform setup / run instructions for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Apps

Pala One supports user-installable apps — self-contained position-independent C binaries that run on top of the firmware and have access to the display, button, RTC, and a per-app key-value store. Apps are uploaded over Wi-Fi through the same web UI used for books, and they appear under the **Apps** entry of the library menu. No firmware rebuild is needed to install one.

See [examples/GETTING_STARTED.md](examples/GETTING_STARTED.md) for the full app-author guide — binary format, the `PalaAPI` (v3), required compiler flags, and upload steps.

### Building an app

You need:
- The `xtensa-esp32s3-elf-gcc` cross-compiler, which ships with the Arduino ESP32 board package. On Linux it is found under `~/.arduino15/packages/esp32/tools/esp-x32/<version>/bin/`; the `Makefile` locates it automatically.
- `python3` (for the post-build step that patches the entry point offset into the binary).

An app is a single C file that includes `pala_app.h` and `pala_api.h` from the firmware source and exports a `void app_main(const PalaAPI* api)` entry point. The header struct at the start of the binary carries the display name and API version check.

See `examples/click_counter/` for a complete working example with a `Makefile`.

```bash
cd examples/click_counter
make
# produces click_counter.bin
```

### Uploading an app

1. Select **Upload** from the library menu on the device.
2. Connect to the `PALA-XXXXXX` WiFi network (password: `palaread`).
3. Open `http://192.168.4.1` in a browser.
4. Use the **Upload app (.bin)** card to upload your `.bin` file.
5. Triple-click to exit upload mode — the app will appear in the Apps menu immediately.

### App API

Apps communicate with the firmware through the `PalaAPI` function pointer table passed to `app_main`. The current API version is **v3** (`PALA_API_VERSION 3` in `pala_app.h`).

#### Display

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `clearScreen()` | Clear the display buffer and prepare a new frame |
| `drawHeader(title)` | Draw the standard section header bar |
| `drawTextAt(x, y, text, bold)` | Draw text at a pixel position |
| `drawCenteredLarge(text)` | Draw text centred on screen in a large font |
| `refreshDisplay()` | Push the frame buffer to the e-ink panel |

#### Input

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `waitForEvent()` | Block until a button gesture; returns `PALA_CLICK` / `PALA_DOUBLE` / `PALA_TRIPLE` / `PALA_LONG` |
| `pollEvent()` | Non-blocking variant; returns 0 if no event is ready |
| `buttonPressed()` | Returns 1 if the button is currently held, 0 otherwise |
| `pendingPresses()` | Count of individual short press-release events since last call; bypasses multi-click grouping |

#### Timing

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `millisNow()` | Current uptime in milliseconds |
| `delayMs(ms)` | Yield for `ms` milliseconds |
| `rtcSeconds()` | Monotonic seconds counter that survives deep sleep; use for cross-session timing |

#### Storage

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `storageRead(key, buf, maxlen)` | Read from `/apps/{key}.dat`; returns bytes read, -1 on error |
| `storageWrite(key, buf, len)` | Write to `/apps/{key}.dat`; returns bytes written, -1 on error |

#### Utilities

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `snprintf_wrap(buf, len, fmt, ...)` | Standard `snprintf` |

Return from `app_main` to exit back to the Apps menu. Apps decide their own exit gesture — the firmware does not impose one.

**Constraints:**
- Apps must be compiled `-fPIC -mlongcalls` (position-independent).
- Apps must not use static mutable variables — the loader does not patch `.data` relocations.
- Maximum binary size: 48 KB.
- The `api_version` field in `PalaAppHeader` must match `PALA_API_VERSION` exactly — the firmware rejects mismatched binaries.
